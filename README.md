# UFO Sightings
## Overview
### The original purpose of this analysis was to upload UFO sighting data to a webpage and then enable users to filter by date. However, upon expanded knowledge of using filters, it was decided that the webpage should enable users to filter by date, city, state, country, and shape. This is performed by using javascript to loop through an array of data. 

## Results
### Upon visiting the website, the user will be greeted to a landing page containing unfiltered data.

### Users are able to filter using a single criteria

## Summary
Overall, the outcome of our code is a simple yet effective way to filter our data. One of the drawbacks to be improved upon in the future is the use of static javascript data, and not a living database. This means the data in data.js will constantly need to be maintained by the host. Other improvements would be to create a user input box to report a siting that can update the database. Additionally, there is no duration filter which would have been a nice to have so that all points of data can be filtered.
