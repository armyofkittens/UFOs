# UFO Sightings
## Overview
### The original purpose of this analysis was to upload UFO sighting data to a webpage and then enable users to filter by date. However, upon expanded knowledge of using filters, it was decided that the webpage should enable users to filter by date, city, state, country, and shape. This is performed by using javascript to loop through an array of data. 

## Results
### Upon visiting the website, the user will be greeted to a landing page containing unfiltered data.
